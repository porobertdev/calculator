## About

This project is part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum. The project's lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator/). I gotta say this gave me lots of headache, because I couldn't figure out the logic, and if I did, then I got stuck because I was coding it right away. I'll try to do better next time! :) Also, my brain didn't feel like it was working good.

I suppose the code is trash and it's probably the worst code I ever wrote so far, but it works...

I've made a [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/s58cOYvBcb3DA3vBfkIoqw/Calculator---%40TheOdinProject?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=6BxoUVtbcfB1pkQU-1) that I used as a starting point.
